# acatloggerbot
## This is an open-source archive for the ACAT Logger Bot discord application, a bot that moderated edited and deleted messages and recorded their previous version. 
The bot's mission was to provide server moderators, administrators, and developers with the tools that allowed them to properly prevent malicious activity in their servers.
The bot's vision was to utilize Discord's bot support through NodeJS, Python, and cloud computing to provide an open-source free service to all Discord servers.

The original intention of the bot was to offer an alternative as mainstream logging bots were unreliable and commonly offline. 
Unfortunately, the bot is now offline as the cloud computing service has declined free use.
